## Entry 1 — Project Initialization

This commit establishes:

- Architectural boundaries
- Layer definitions
- Responsibility separation
- Security philosophy
- Consistency model assumptions

No functionality is implemented.

Rationale:

Documentation must precede implementation to prevent boundary drift.
The database is a distributed system component.
Financial systems fail when boundaries are implicit.

This repository begins by making boundaries explicit.
